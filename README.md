# PorfolioReactZ

Being a web developer means being part of a community. Everyone needs a place not only to share their projects while applying for jobs or working as a freelancer but also to share their work with other developers and collaborate on projects.

This project displays a portfolio using React skills, which helps set you apart from other developers whose portfolios don’t use the latest technologies.


## User Story

AS AN employer looking for candidates with experience building single-page applications<br>
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed React portfolio of work samples<br>
SO THAT I can assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position


## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN a single-page application portfolio for a web developer
* WHEN I load the portfolio<br>
THEN I am presented with a page containing a header, a section for content.
* WHEN I view the header<br>
THEN I am presented with the developer's name and navigation with titles corresponding to different sections of the portfolio
* WHEN I view the navigation titles<br>
THEN I am presented with the titles About Me, Portfolio, Contact, and Resume, and the title corresponding to the current section is highlighted
* WHEN I click on a navigation title<br>
THEN the browser URL changes and I am presented with the corresponding section below the navigation and that title is highlighted
